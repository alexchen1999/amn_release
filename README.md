# Artificial Metabolic Networks

## In this repo you will find different notebooks for different purposes:

### Making training sets for AMNs, with main_Training_set.ipynb

### Building and training AMNs, with main_Build_and_Train.ipynb

### Processing raw experimental data and making AMN-suitable datasets from these, with Xpal_data_processing.ipynb and Make_xpal_training_set.ipynb

### Generating appropriate media compositions to test in the lab, with Make_compositions_files.ipynb

### Test the predictive performance of blackboxes on experimental training sets (will be removed!!)
